This is the Odin Project Recipes project. The task is to create a website with an index page that contains linkes to several recipes.

Once I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

Creating a Github repo, cloning it locally using the SSH protocol, and working with Git and VSCode through the command line interface.
