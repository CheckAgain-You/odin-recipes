This is the Odin Project Recipes project. The task is to create a website with an index page that contains linkes to several recipes.

Once I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

Creating a Github repo, cloning it locally using the SSH protocol, and working with Git and VSCode through the command line interface.

Creating HTML docs, adding the HTML boilerplate from memory, and adding relative links to and from the website's home page.

Adding images into documents with attribution.

Creating ordered and unordered lists.
